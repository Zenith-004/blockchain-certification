# 🛡️ Blockchain-Based File Forgery Prevention

## 🚀 Overview
In an age where digital documents can be easily manipulated, ensuring authenticity is crucial. This project harnesses **blockchain technology** to prevent file forgery by transforming documents into **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**. This way, documents become **tamper-proof**, **verifiable**, and **permanently stored** on the blockchain, guaranteeing trust and integrity.

## ✨ Features
✅ **File Integrity Verification** – Leverages blockchain immutability to ensure document authenticity.

🎭 **NFT-Based Storage** – Converts documents into NFTs, making them unique and verifiable.

🔗 **Decentralized Verification** – Uses smart contracts to confirm a document’s trustworthiness.

🔑 **Metamask Integration** – Enables secure authentication and transaction signing.

⚡ **Next.js & React.js Frontend** – Delivers a seamless and interactive user experience.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum 🏛️
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity ⛓️
- **Development Framework**: Hardhat 🔥
- **Frontend**: Next.js & React.js 🎨
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask 🔐
- **Storage**: IPFS or other decentralized solutions 📦

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/blockchain-file-forgery-prevention.git
cd blockchain-file-forgery-prevention
```
### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
### 3️⃣ Start Local Blockchain (Hardhat)
```sh
npx hardhat node
```
### 4️⃣ Deploy Smart Contracts
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
### 5️⃣ Run the Frontend
```sh
npm run dev
```
### 6️⃣ Connect Wallet & Upload Documents
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 🌍
- Connect with **MetaMask** 🦊
- Upload your document 📄
- Get a unique **NFT-based certificate** 🎫

## 📜 How It Works
1️⃣ **User Uploads a Document** 🆙 → It is **hashed** and stored on **IPFS**.

2️⃣ **NFT is Minted** 🎨 → The document’s hash is **linked** to an NFT on the blockchain.

3️⃣ **Verification Process** 🔍 → Any user can verify the document’s authenticity by checking the NFT’s metadata.

## 🔥 Why This Matters
📌 **Tamper-Proof** – No one can alter the stored document once recorded on the blockchain.

📌 **Decentralized** – No need for central authorities; verification is open to all.

📌 **Transparent** – Blockchain ensures full traceability and accountability.

📌 **Secure** – Cryptographic hashing and NFTs guarantee document uniqueness and authenticity.
